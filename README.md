## 🎮 Developing & Testing

### Running the Server

If you do not see the **HytaleServer** run configuration in the top-right dropdown, click "Edit Configurations..." to unhide it. Press the **Green Play Button** to start, or the **Bug Icon** to start in Debug Mode to enable breakpoints.

### Verifying the Setup

1. Launch your standard Hytale Client.
2. Connect to `Local Server` (127.0.0.1).
3. Type `/test` in-game. If it returns your plugin version, everything is working!

### Bundling Assets

You can include models and textures by placing them in `src/main/resources/Common/` or `src/main/resources/Server/`. These are editable in real-time using the in-game **Asset Editor**.
